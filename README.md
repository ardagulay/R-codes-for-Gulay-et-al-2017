# R-codes-for-Gulay-et-al-2017
Ths repository includes R codes for manuscript titled "Ammonium oxidation is driven by comammox Nitrospira and heterotrophic nitrifiers in groundwater-fed biofilters"

The following codes were developed:

(1) R codes to normalize sequence libraries from stable isotope probing experiments

(2) R codes to calculate genus specific 95% CIs

(3) R codes to calculate 13C labelled OTUs by estimating the buoyant density (BD) shifts from DNA-SIP experiments using the algorithm given in "Ammonium oxidation is driven by comammox Nitrospira and heterotrophic nitrifiers in groundwater-fed biofilters"

(4) R codes to calculate 13C labelled OTUs by estimating the buoyant density (BD) shifts from RNA-SIP experiments using the algorithm developed in Zemb et al., 2012.
